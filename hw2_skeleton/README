# README FILE
# Machine Learning
# Assignment 2
#
# After completing the assignment, fill in this README file.  It asks you to duplicate
# your answer to several questions.  Be certain that your answers in this README file
# (which will be used for auto-grading) match the answers in your PDF writeup.
#
# This README file is formatted in YAML to allow it to be machine readable.  Please
# be very careful with how you edit it, being careful to following the formatting.
# Make certain not to change any text in all UPPERCASE.  After editing, you can make 
# certain that your README file follows proper YAML syntax by running it through an
# online YAML checker, such as http://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com/
# 
# The most frequent error is multi-line strings, such as "SOURCESCONSULTED" and 
# "FEEDBACK_ERRORS".  Make certain that the previous line ends with a | followed by a 
# newline.  Then, make certain that the subsequent lines are indented one level in 
# (4 spaces).  This sounds complex, but just follow the existing format of this file.
# If you run into any problems that you can't fix easily in listing your sources or 
# providing feedback on the assignment, just include your multi-line string answers to
# these parts as comments.  Everything else (all simple one-word or numeric answers) must
# be properly formatted YAML.

# Answer to Implementation Exercise 2.3:  Analysis of the regularization parameter
#######################################################################################

# Copy and paste your brief paragraph describing the effect of the regularization 
# parameter from your PDF.
LOGREGIMPLEMENTATION_REGULARIZATION_ANALYSIS:
As we increase the lambda, we ‘blur’ the boundary, which leads probability to be less deterministic. As we decrease the lambda, the result turned to be more polarized. As we increase the lambda, bias increase and variance decrease. As we decrease the lambda, biases decrease and variances increase.

# Answer to Implementation Exercise 3.4:  Effect of Kernel Parameters
#######################################################################################

# Copy and paste your brief paragraph describing the effect of varying the kernel  
# parameters and C from your PDF.
SVM_KERNELPARAMETEREFFECTS:
Poly: As we increase the degree in SVM polynomial Kernel, the decision boundary tends to be increasingly complicate curve. Biases decreases while variances increases,  which cause over-fitting on training data. As we increase the C in SVM, the decision boundary also increasingly classifies all training data correct, but tends to lose natural separation between the data.Biases decreases while variances increases,  which also cause over-fitting on training data.
Gaussian: 
As we decrease the sigma in SVM Gaussian Kernel, the decision boundary tends to be increasingly fits every data, and finally converge around some data point. Biases decreases while variances increases,  which cause over-fitting on training data.  As we increase the C in SVM, the decision boundary also increasingly classifies all training data correct, decreases biases while increases variances,causing over-fitting on training data.
